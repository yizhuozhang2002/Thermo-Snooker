## Thermo-Snooker
This project is a simulation of gas molecules inside a two-dimensional container, designed as part of a second-year thermodynamics course. The simulation models molecular motion, collisions, and thermodynamic properties using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python.

# Molecular Motion: 
Simulates gas molecules moving inside a 2D box, incorporating velocity and kinetic energy calculations.
# Elastic Collisions: 
Implements realistic elastic collisions between molecules and with the container walls, conserving momentum and energy.
# Temperature and Pressure Analysis: 
Computes macroscopic thermodynamic properties like temperature and pressure using statistical methods.
# Visual Representation: 
Uses matplotlib to animate the molecular interactions and visualize gas dynamics over time.
# Parameter Customization: 
Allows users to adjust the number of molecules, initial velocities, and other system parameters.
